## Hellenad. Year: unknown. Bargul: the magician.

The last of his kind, an expert on the misteries of the universe and the dark magic, guardian of the galactic maps that for many years his antencessors had been drawing. 

He cannot believe what his calculations suggest: after many years studying the stars, nothing would indicate the inminent disaster closing in on Hellenad.

Cuadrant 31 of the galactic maps indicates an anomaly in the course of a cluster of meteors, the remains of a planet named Bugurian, and now they are heading straight to his own roof!
